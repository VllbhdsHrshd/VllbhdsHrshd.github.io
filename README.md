# About Me
Hey There, I'm Harshad. Currently I'm working as a Research Intern at AIISC under Dr. Amitava Das, on detection of AI generated images and Vision Language Model. Prior to that, I've completed my Master's with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, from NIT Agartala, under the supervision of Dr. Smita Das, where I happen to work on various Deep Learning projects with a special focus on Deep Generative Models.

## Research Interest(s)
My research interest lies in (but not confined to) the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Generative Models, and Reinforcement Learning. I love working on the creative aspect of the Generative AI, Vision Language Model and Multimodal Deep Learning.
